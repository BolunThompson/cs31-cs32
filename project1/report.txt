1. I inputed 0 registered voters, 1 Trarris voter, and 0 Hump voters to get the 
   nonsencical output of "inf%" Trarris voters and "-nan%" Hump voters.
   The exact input and output follows:
 > How many registered voters were surveyed? 0
 > How many of them say they will probably vote for Trarris? 1
 > How many of them say they will probably vote for Hump? 0
 
 > inf% say they will probably vote for Trarris.
 > -nan% say they will probably vote for Hump.
 > Trarris is predicted to win the election.
